# Task Manager Web Application

## Overview

This is a sleek, responsive web-based **Task Manager** application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively, offering a clean and modern user interface with features for adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks. Tasks are stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring persistence even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can enter a task and click the "Add" button to store it.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify previously added tasks with ease.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed with a single click. Completed tasks are styled differently and timestamped.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks permanently.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts across screen sizes for optimal user experience.
- **Modern UI**: Uses glassmorphism and a gradient background for an attractive look.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Provides the structure of the app.
- **CSS** – Responsible for the modern styling, including glass effects and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** – Adds interactivity and functionality such as task management and storage.

## How It Works

- The app initializes by fetching any previously saved tasks from `localStorage`.
- Users interact with the input field to add new tasks.
- Each task appears in the "Pending" or "Completed" list based on its status.
- Buttons are provided for editing, completing, and deleting tasks.
- Every action updates the local storage and reflects immediately in the UI.
