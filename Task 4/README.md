# Ice Cream Shop Web Application

Welcome to the Ice Cream Shop web application! This project demonstrates a responsive and interactive login/register system that leads users to a vibrant landing page showcasing a popsicle product. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a clean, modern UI inspired by creative landing page design.

## Features

- **User Authentication Interface**:  
  The homepage provides a login and registration form side by side. New users can sign up, and existing users can log in to access a protected page.

- **Form Validation & Navigation**:  
  The JavaScript (`script.js`) file handles form interactions, including switching between login and register modes and checking for basic input validation. On successful login, users are redirected to the secure landing page (`secure.html`).

- **Secure Landing Page**:  
  Once logged in, users are taken to a visually appealing landing page featuring:
  - Navigation menu (Home, Menu, About, Contact)
  - Promotional section with catchy taglines
  - High-resolution images of ice cream products
  - Footer with location, social media icons, and a natural ingredients badge

- **Responsive Design**:  
  The CSS (`style.css`) is fully responsive. It uses flexbox layouts and media queries to ensure smooth usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Project Structure
